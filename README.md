100DaysOfCoding
July 21, 2024, marks the beginning of a continuous 100-day coding journey! Regardless of the programming language, technique, app, or project, what matters is that I am coding. The goal is to immerse myself in a learning loop for 100 days. Every line of code teaches me something new.
"It's okay if the programmer doesn't code every day, but it's not okay to have a day when they can't code at all!"
